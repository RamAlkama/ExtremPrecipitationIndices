# Extreme precipitation indices In Google Earth Engine 
# Two examples are used here: ERA5 and CHIRPS data 

The indices of extreme precipitation are a set of climate indices that are used to assess changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme precipitation events over time. These indices are used to monitor and detect changes in the occurrence and intensity of extreme precipitation events, which can be important indicators of climate change.

Indices of extreme precipitation include in the java script codes are:
CDD: Consecutive Dry Days 
CWD: Consecutive Wet Days 
PRCPTOT: annual total precip  (mm/year)
R10: number of heavy precipitation days (nbr days with P>10mm/day)
R20: number of heavy precipitation days (nbr days with P>20mm/day)
R95p: Annual total PRCP when RR > 95th percentile (mm/year)
R99p: Annual total PRCP when RR > 99th percentile (mm/year)
SDII:	Simple daily intensity index	Annual total precipitation divided by the number of wet days (mm/day)
Pmax: daily max precip (mm/day)
Pmax5 : maximum 5 days precipitation (mm/5days)
 

These indices can be used to study the temporal and spatial patterns of extreme precipitation, and to analyze the changes in extreme precipitation events over time.
