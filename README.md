The indices of extreme precipitation are a set of climate indices that are used to assess changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme precipitation events over time. These indices are used to monitor and detect changes in the occurrence and intensity of extreme precipitation events, which can be important indicators of climate change.

Indices of extreme precipitation included in the two java script codes are:
 1) CDD: Consecutive Dry Days 
 2) CWD: Consecutive Wet Days 
 3) PRCPTOT: annual total precip  (mm/year)
 4) R10: number of heavy precipitation days (nbr days with P>10mm/day)
 5) R20: number of heavy precipitation days (nbr days with P>20mm/day)
 6) R95p: Annual total PRCP when RR > 95th percentile (mm/year)
 7) R99p: Annual total PRCP when RR > 99th percentile (mm/year)
 8) SDII:	Simple daily intensity index	Annual total precipitation divided by the number of wet days (mm/day)
 9) Pmax: daily max precip (mm/day)
 10) Pmax5 : maximum 5 days precipitation (mm/5days)
 

These indices can be used to study the temporal and spatial patterns of extreme precipitation, and to analyze the changes in extreme precipitation events over time.
